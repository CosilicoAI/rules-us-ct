            <p>Sec. 12-16. Procedure against judge of probate for failure to furnish copies.The judge of any court of probate who fails to deliver or to cause to be delivered to the commissioner any certified copy or other document within the time required by statute for the delivery of the same, on application of the commissioner to the superior court of the judicial district wherein such judge of probate resides, or to any judge of the Superior Court when the same is not in session in such judicial district, showing such failure, may be required by such court or such judge to deliver the same within such time as is designated by such court or such judge. On receipt of such application, the court or judge, as the case may be, shall designate a time when and place where a hearing thereon will be had, and shall cite the judge of probate named in such application to appear at the time and place so designated to show cause why he has failed to cause such copy or document to be delivered to the commissioner.
