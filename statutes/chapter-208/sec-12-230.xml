            <p>Sec. 12-230. Forfeiture of corporate rights for failure to make returns.Any corporation required to file a return with the commissioner by the provisions of this part which neglects to file the same for two consecutive fiscal years shall be construed to have forfeited its corporate rights and powers, and its existence as a corporation shall be terminated in the manner provided in section33-890. A certificate of the commissioner lodged in the office of the Secretary of the State showing the delinquency of any such corporation shall be prima facie evidence of such delinquency, and the secretary, in each such case of default, shall proceed in the manner prescribed in said section33-890, except that, immediately following the lodgment of such certificate by the commissioner, the secretary shall notify such corporation and, if such corporation fails to file any return due the state within sixty days from the date of such notice, the secretary shall record in the records of corporations in his office a certificate signed by him showing that the corporate rights and powers of such corporation have been forfeited by reason of such default. Each such corporation may be reinstated and the property rights thereof and of the creditors and of all persons concerned shall be protected in the manner provided in section33-892.
