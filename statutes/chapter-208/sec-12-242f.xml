Obligations of fiduciary.Any fiduciary who conducts or is liquidating the business or is selling the assets of any company shall be subject to the payment of taxes imposed by this part in the same manner and to the same extent as if the business were being conducted or liquidated or assets sold by agents or officers of such company. A fiduciary who has been appointed during an income year shall make payments on account of estimated taxes both for that part of the income year during which the company exercised its franchise as well as for that part of the income year in which the fiduciary himself was acting.
