For purposes of this subsection reinsurance premiums received in respect of property or risks located or resident in this state, whether or not otherwise determinable, may, at the election of the company, be determined either on the basis of the proportion which reinsurance premiums received from domestic insurance companies bear to reinsurance premiums received from all sources or, alternatively, on the basis of the proportion which the aggregate amount of gross direct premiums received for insurance on property or risks located or resident in this state by all the companies which ceded reinsurance to the taxpayer in the income year bears to the aggregate amount of gross direct premiums received by said companies from all sources.
