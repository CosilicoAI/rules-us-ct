            <p>Sec. 12-313. Administration. Regulations. Waiver of filing of reports.The administration of this chapter is vested in the Commissioner of Revenue Services. All forms necessary and proper for the enforcement of this chapter shall be prescribed and furnished by the commissioner. The commissioner may require any agent, clerk, stenographer or other assistant to execute a bond in such sum as said commissioner determines for the faithful discharge of his duties. The commissioner may prescribe regulations and rulings, not inconsistent with law, to carry into effect the provisions of this chapter, which regulations and rulings, when reasonably designed to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter, shall be prima facie evidence of its proper interpretation. The commissioner shall, at least annually, and more often in his discretion, publish for distribution all regulations prescribed hereunder and such rulings as appear to him to be of general interest. The commissioner may, in his discretion, waive the requirements of filing reports when it appears to his satisfaction that the distributor is not engaged in handling unstamped cigarettes.
