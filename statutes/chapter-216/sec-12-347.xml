If such satisfactory evidence is not presented at such time, the transfer shall not be exempt; but, if such satisfactory evidence is presented to the commissioner within five years after the date of the transferor's death, the commissioner shall recompute the tax, treating such transfers as exempt, and shall, with the written approval of the Attorney General, present the matter to the Comptroller for a refund.</p>
