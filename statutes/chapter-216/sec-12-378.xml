              <p>In each case in which the judge of the probate court having jurisdiction of the estate of a deceased person believes that the estate is not subject to tax under this chapter, such judge shall send a written opinion to the Commissioner of Revenue Services, with the copy of the tax return provided for in section12-359, setting forth the judge's reasons for such opinion. Thirty days after the date on which such opinion is filed, the opinion shall be conclusive evidence that all real property included in the gross taxable estate is free from any claim for tax due the state under this chapter in respect to the interest of such deceased person in such real property, and that no tax is due from the estate, unless,</p>

The probate court may, at any time, correct an error or mistake in the opinion. If said judge has filed an opinion that no tax is due from an estate and the Commissioner of Revenue Services has not filed an objection to such opinion on or before the thirtieth day after the filing of such opinion, said judge shall issue a certificate reciting that no tax under this chapter is due from the estate, which shall be conclusive proof that any lien on such property under section12-366or section12-364is discharged. Such certificate may be recorded in the office of the town clerk of the town in which the real property is situated.</p>

A copy of the final receipt or of such certificate, if any, that the commissioner is required to provide under this subsection, with the amount of the gross taxable estate shown thereon, shall be filed with the probate court and sent to the fiduciary or transferee and no representative of an estate shall be entitled to a final accounting unless such final receipt or such certificate, if any, that said commissioner is required to provide under this subsection, has been filed with the probate court. Such final receipt filed with the probate court shall be conclusive evidence that all real property included in the gross taxable estate is free from any claim for tax due the state under this chapter in respect to the interest of such deceased person in such real property.
