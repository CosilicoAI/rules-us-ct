              <p>The Commissioner of Social Services, after consultation with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, may provide, within available appropriations, payments to long-term care facilities for the care of certain illegal immigrants who were admitted to a long-term care facility before July 1, 2011. Payments may be made to cover the costs of care, as well as other incidentals as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services, for illegal immigrants who have been admitted to an acute care or psychiatric hospital and for whom services available in a long-term care facility are an appropriate and cost-effective alternative. Such individuals must be otherwise eligible for Medicaid, have resided in this state for at least five years and be unable to return to their country of origin due to medical illness or regulations barring reentry of persons who are ill or disabled or based upon a decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service not to proceed with deportation.</p>
