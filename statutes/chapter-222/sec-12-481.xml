            <p>Sec. 12-481. Bond for payment of tax.A motor carrier may give a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to issue bonds in the state, in an amount satisfactory to the Commissioner of Revenue Services which shall be not less than one thousand dollars or more than ten thousand dollars payable to the state of Connecticut and conditioned that the carrier will pay all taxes due and to become due under this chapter from the date of the bond to the date when either the carrier or the bonding company notifies the Commissioner of Revenue Services that the bond has been cancelled. As long as the bond remains in force, the Commissioner of Revenue Services may order refunds to the motor carrier in the amounts appearing to be due on applications filed by the carrier under section12-480without first auditing the records of the carrier. The surety shall be liable for all omitted taxes assessed against the carrier, including the penalties and interest on such taxes provided in section12-488, even though the assessment is made after cancellation of the bond, but only for such taxes due and payable while the bond was in force and penalties and interest on such taxes.
