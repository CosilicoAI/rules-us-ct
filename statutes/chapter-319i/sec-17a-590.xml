The facility to which the acquittee has been referred for examination shall perform the examination and submit a written report of its findings to the board. If the facility finds that treatment of the person is appropriate, it shall include its recommendations for treatment in the report to the board. Whenever treatment is provided by the facility, the facility shall furnish reports to the board on a regular basis concerning the status of the acquittee and the degree to which the acquittee is a danger to himself or others. The board shall furnish copies of all such reports to the acquittee, counsel for the acquittee and the state's attorney. Psychiatric or psychological reports concerning the acquittee that are in the possession of the board shall not be public records, as defined in section1-200, except that information in such reports relied on by the board or used as evidence concerning the discharge, conditional release, temporary leave or confinement of the acquittee shall not be confidential.
