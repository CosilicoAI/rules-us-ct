                <p>Unlawful advertising.No retailer shall advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any consumer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer or that it will not be added to the sales price of the property sold or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded. Under the provisions of this section, however, a retailer may advertise the sale of tangible personal property by any of the following methods: By stating the sales price alone without reference to the tax; by stating separately the sales price and the amount of tax to be collected thereon; by stating the sales price “plus tax” or “exclusive of tax” or by stating a sales price which includes the tax, together with the words “tax included” or “tax incl.”; provided the retailer in the case of all such sales shall maintain his records to show separately the actual price of such sales and the amount of the tax paid thereon; and provided such retailer, if requested, shall furnish the consumer with a sales slip or other like evidence of the sale, showing the tax separately computed thereon. Any person violating any provision of this subsection shall be fined five hundred dollars for each offense.</p>
