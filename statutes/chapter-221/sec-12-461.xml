            <p>Sec. 12-461. Hearings before commissioner concerning any tax, penalty or interest under this chapter. Request for hearing by distributor. Related procedures.Any distributor aggrieved by the action of the commissioner or his authorized agent in fixing the amount of any tax, penalty or interest provided for by this chapter may apply to the commissioner, in writing, within sixty days after the notice of such action is delivered or mailed to it, for a hearing and a correction of the amount of such tax, penalty or interest so fixed, setting forth the reasons why such hearing should be granted and the amount in which such tax, penalty or interest should be reduced. The commissioner shall promptly consider each such application and may grant or deny the hearing requested. If the hearing is denied, the applicant shall be notified forthwith. If it is granted, the commissioner shall notify the applicant of the time and place fixed for such hearing. After such hearing the commissioner may make such order in the premises as appears to him just and lawful and shall furnish a copy of such order to the applicant. The commissioner may, by notice in writing, at any time within three years after the date when any return of any distributor has been due, order a hearing on his own initiative and require the distributor or any other individual whom he believes to be in possession of relevant information concerning the distributor to appear before him or his authorized agent with any specified books of account, papers or other documents, for examination under oath. The commissioner, after a hearing, may suspend or revoke the distributor's license of any distributor violating any provision of this chapter.
