            <p>Sec. 12-30b. Limit on interest to be paid on certain tax overpayments.Notwithstanding any provision of any chapter of this title authorizing the Superior Court to grant such relief as may be equitable and, if tax has been paid prior to the granting of such relief, to order the Treasurer to pay interest on the amount of such relief, the equitable powers of the Superior Court shall not include: (1) The power to order the Treasurer to pay interest on the amount of such relief, if the provisions of the chapter pursuant to which the appeal was taken to the Superior Court do not authorize the Commissioner of Revenue Services to pay interest on tax overpayments under said chapter, or (2) the power to order the Treasurer to pay interest in an amount exceeding the amount of interest that the Commissioner of Revenue Services would be authorized to pay, if the provisions of the chapter pursuant to which the appeal was taken to the Superior Court authorize the Commissioner of Revenue Services to pay interest on tax overpayments under said chapter.
