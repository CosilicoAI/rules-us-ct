            <p>Sec. 17b-100. (Formerly Sec. 17-83l). Fraudulent conveyance for purpose of obtaining assistance. Civil action by commissioner.It shall constitute a fraudulent conveyance as against the state for any person to assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of property for less than fair market value, for the purpose of qualifying for public assistance or state-administered general assistance to a transferee either having knowledge of such purpose, or having knowledge that such conveyance leaves the transferor without sufficient means to support himself on a reasonable standard of health and decency. The Commissioner of Social Services, may institute a civil action (1) to set aside any such conveyance and to recover from the proceeds of such property the cost of any assistance provided to the transferor, or (2) to recover from the proceeds of such conveyance the cost of any assistance provided to the transferor. The commissioner may require that any remaining proceeds be applied to such transferor's future support. The commissioner's total recovery under this section shall not exceed the amount by which the fair market value of such property exceeds the consideration exchanged therefor by the transferee. Such civil action shall be brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or in any other venue otherwise appropriate. In any such action brought to set aside a conveyance or to recover the proceeds of a conveyance, made within twenty-four months before the date of such application for assistance directly or indirectly to a transferee who is a parent, grandparent, descendant or spouse of the transferor, the transferee shall bear the burden of proving that the conveyance was not fraudulent.
See Sec. 17b-600 re eligibility for assistance for the aged, blind or totally disabled.
