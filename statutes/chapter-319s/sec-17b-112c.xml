              <p>Qualified aliens, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, who do not qualify for federally-funded cash assistance, other lawfully residing immigrant aliens or aliens who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law shall be eligible for solely state-funded temporary family assistance or cash assistance under the state-administered general assistance program, provided other conditions of eligibility are met. An individual who is granted assistance under this section must pursue citizenship to the maximum extent allowed by law as a condition of eligibility unless incapable of doing so due to a medical problem, language barrier or other reason as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any qualified alien or other lawfully residing immigrant alien or alien who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law who is a victim of domestic violence or who has intellectual disability shall be eligible for assistance under this section.</p>
