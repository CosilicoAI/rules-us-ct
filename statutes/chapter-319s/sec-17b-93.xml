              <p>On and after July 1, 2022, the state shall not recover properly paid cash assistance or medical assistance, including by means of a lien filed on any real property, or a claim filed against property, a property interest or estate or claim of any kind, unless the state is required to recover such assistance under federal law or the provisions of this section. Any lien on real property or state claim against property, a property interest or estate or claim of any kind filed under this section by or on behalf of the state prior to July 1, 2022, shall be deemed released by the state if the recovery of such assistance is not required under federal law or the provisions of this section. As used in this subsection, “cash assistance” means payments made to a beneficiary of the aid to families with dependent children program, the state-administered general assistance program, the state supplement program or the temporary family assistance program.</p>

The state of Connecticut shall have a lien against property of any kind or interest in any property, estate or claim of any kind of the parent of an aid to dependent children or temporary family assistance beneficiary, in addition and not in substitution of any other state claim, for amounts owing under any order for support of any court or any family support magistrate, including any arrearage under such order, except the following shall be exempt from such lien:</p>
