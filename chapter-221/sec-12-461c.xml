Procedure for sale thereof.When any property has been seized under the provisions of section12-461a, the commissioner may, at his discretion, after a hearing as provided in section12-461, advertise such property for sale in a newspaper published or having a circulation in the town in which the seizure took place, at least five days before the sale. Any person claiming an interest in such property may make written application to the commissioner for a hearing, stating his interest in the property and his reasons why such interest should not be forfeited. Further proceedings on such application for hearing shall be taken as provided in sections12-461and12-463. No sale of any property under the provisions of section12-461ashall be made while an application for a hearing is pending before the commissioner, but the pendency of an appeal under the provisions of said section12-463shall not prevent the sale unless the appellant posts a satisfactory bond, with surety, in an amount double the estimated value of the property, conditioned upon the successful termination of the appeal. When any such sale has been consummated, the proceeds thereof shall become the property of the state, provided any person who has an interest in such property shall have the same rights with respect to the proceeds of such sale as such person had in relation to such property prior to sale.
