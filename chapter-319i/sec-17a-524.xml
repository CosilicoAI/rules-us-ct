          <content>
            <p>Sec. 17a-524. (Formerly Sec. 17-201). Writ of habeas corpus.Each person confined in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities in this state shall be entitled to the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, and the question of the legality of such confinement in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities shall be determined by the court or judge issuing such writ. Such writ shall be directed to the superintendent or director of the hospital and, if illegality or invalidity of the commitment is alleged in such writ, a copy shall also be directed to the judge of the committing court as to such claim, and such judge shall be represented by the state's attorney for the judicial district wherein such committing court is located. If the court or judge before whom such case is brought decides that the confinement is not illegal, such decision shall be no bar to the issuing of such writ a second time, if it is claimed that such person is no longer subject to the condition for which he was confined. Such writ may be applied for by such confined person or on his behalf by any relative, friend or person interested in his welfare. No court fees shall be charged against the superintendent or director of the hospital or the judge.
