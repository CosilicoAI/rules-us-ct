Said court may render judgment against the defendant, or each or any of the several defendants, in favor of the state for the balance of the charges remaining unpaid for which such defendants are liable, and payment of such judgment may be secured by attachment and execution issued thereon. The limitation of action provided in section52-576shall apply only to any such claim against a relative as such, and any claim by the state for reimbursement of the balance of the billed charges remaining unpaid from the estate of any deceased person shall be presented to the executor or administrator thereof within the time limited for the presentation of other claims against such estate.</p>
