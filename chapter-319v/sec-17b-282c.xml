              <p>All nonemergency dental services provided under the Department of Social Services' dental programs, as described in section17b-282b, shall be subject to prior authorization. Nonemergency services that are exempt from the prior authorization process shall include diagnostic, prevention, basic restoration procedures and nonsurgical extractions that are consistent with standard and reasonable dental practices. Payment for nonemergency dental services shall not exceed one thousand dollars per calendar year for an individual adult, provided services determined to be medically necessary, as defined in section17b-259b, including dentures, shall not be subject to such payment cap. Dental benefit limitations shall apply to each client regardless of the number of providers serving the client. The commissioner may recoup payments for services that are determined not to be for an emergency condition or otherwise in excess of what is medically necessary. The commissioner shall periodically, but not less than quarterly, review payments for emergency dental services and basic restoration procedures for appropriateness of payment. For the purposes of this section, “emergency condition” means a dental condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate dental attention to result in placing the health of the individual, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child, in serious jeopardy, cause serious impairment to body functions or cause serious dysfunction of any body organ or part.</p>

              <p>The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures necessary to administer the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures as regulation, provided the commissioner prints notice of intent to adopt regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after the date of implementation. Policies and procedures implemented pursuant to this section shall be valid until the time final regulations are adopted.
