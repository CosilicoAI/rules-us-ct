            <p>Sec. 17b-233. (Formerly Sec. 17-307). Care of handicapped and other children at Newington Children's Hospital. Children with drug-related conditions not to be admitted.Newington Children's Hospital may admit any child who is handicapped or afflicted with any pediatric illness upon application of the selectmen of any town, or the guardian or any relative of such child, or any public health agency, physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, provided, no person shall be admitted primarily for the treatment of any drug-related condition. Said hospital shall admit such child to said hospital if such child is pronounced by a physician, a physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse on the staff of said hospital, after examination, to be suitable for admission, and said hospital shall keep and support such child for such length of time as it deems proper. Said hospital shall not be required to admit any such child unless it can conveniently receive and care for such child at the time application is made and said hospital may return to the town in which such child resides any child so taken who is pronounced by a physician, a physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse on the staff of said hospital, after examination, to be unsuitable for retention or who, by reason of improvement in his condition or completion of his treatment or training, ought not to be further retained. The hospital may refuse to admit any child pronounced by a physician, a physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse on the staff of said hospital, after examination, to be unsuitable for admission and may refuse to admit any such child when the facilities at the hospital will not, in the judgment of such physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, permit the hospital to care for such child adequately and properly.
