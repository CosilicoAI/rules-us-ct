            <p>Sec. 17b-265f. Payment by the department for pharmacy claims. Limitations. Investigation of pharmacy.No pharmacy shall claim payment from the Department of Social Services under a medical assistance program administered by the department for prescription drugs dispensed to individuals who have other prescription drug insurance coverage unless such coverage has been exhausted and the individual is otherwise eligible for such a medical assistance program. The department shall recoup from the submitting pharmacy any claims submitted to and paid by the department when other insurance coverage is available. The department shall investigate a pharmacy that consistently submits ineligible claims for payment to determine whether the pharmacy is in violation of its medical assistance provider agreement or is committing fraud or abuse in the program and based on the findings of such investigation, may take action against such pharmacy, in accordance with state and federal law.
