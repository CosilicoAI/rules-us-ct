            <p>Sec. 12-191. Final judgment. Certificate of foreclosure.Upon the expiration of the period for redemption, the court shall make a final judgment of the foreclosure of the tax lien or liens upon any such properties not withdrawn or redeemed and direct that possession of such property be given to the municipality or municipalities having the lien or liens thereon. Upon the rendition of such judgment, all persons having any right, title or interest in or to such properties shall be forever barred and foreclosed of their rights therein. The tax collector shall, thereupon, sign and file in the office of the town clerk for record a separate certificate of foreclosure as to each of such properties, describing it as it appears as listed in the petition. Such certificate shall be substantially as follows:
“To all whom it may concern: This certifies that a tax lien (or liens) for unpaid taxes due the .... of .... upon property standing upon the land records of the town of .... in the name of .... and described as follows: .... was foreclosed upon petition of said .... of .... filed in the superior court for the judicial district of .... under the provisions of section12-183on the .... day of ...., 20.., no person having a right, title or interest in said property having redeemed the same and that title to said property has become absolute in said .... of .....
