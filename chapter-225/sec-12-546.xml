            <p>Sec. 12-546. Sale of business, stock or facilities. Purchaser's duties and liabilities. Certificate of clearance.If any person liable for any amount under this chapter sells his business, stock of goods, or facilities, the successor shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount, until a certificate of clearance from the Commissioner of Revenue Services is issued. If the purchaser fails to withhold from the purchase price as required, he shall be liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate of clearance, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address, as it appears on the records of the Department of Revenue Services, of the amount that must be paid. Failure of the commissioner to mail this notice shall release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as above provided.
