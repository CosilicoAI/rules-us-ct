              <p>The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall prepare and maintain a register of persons who are blind in this state which shall describe their condition, cause of blindness and capacity for education and rehabilitative training. The commissioner may register cases of persons who are liable to become visually impaired or blind, and may take such measures in cooperation with other authorities as the commissioner deems advisable for the prevention of blindness or conservation of eyesight and, in appropriate cases, for the education of children and for the vocational guidance of adults whose eyesight approaches visual impairment or blindness. The commissioner shall establish criteria for low vision care and maintain a list of ophthalmologists and optometrists that are exclusively authorized to receive agency funds through established and existing state fee schedules for the delivery of specifically defined low vision services that increase the capacity of eligible recipients of such services to maximize the use of their remaining vision.</p>
