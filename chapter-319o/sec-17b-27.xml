Each such protocol shall assure that the participants are informed, are competent to understand and agree to an affirmation or acknowledgment of parentage, and that any such affirmation or acknowledgment is voluntary and free from coercion. Each such protocol shall also provide for the training of all staff members involved in the voluntary parentage establishment process so that such staff members will understand their obligations to implement the voluntary parentage establishment program in such a way that the participants are informed, are competent to understand and agree to an affirmation or acknowledgment of parentage, and that any such affirmation or acknowledgment is voluntary and free from coercion. No entity may participate in the program until its protocol has been approved by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make all protocols and proposed protocols available for public inspection. No entity or location at which all or a substantial portion of occupants are present involuntarily, including, but not limited to, a prison or a mental hospital, but excluding any site having a research and demonstration project established under subsection</p>
