              <p>To any taxes which are assessed under section12-593, there shall be added interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof which elapses from the date when the original tax became due and payable. The amount of such tax and any penalty or interest in respect to such tax, due and unpaid, may be collected under the provisions of section12-35. The warrant therein provided for shall be signed by the Commissioner of Revenue Services or his authorized agent. The amount of any such tax, penalty and interest shall be a lien, from the last day of the month next preceding the due date of such tax until discharged by payment, against all real estate of the company within the state and a certificate of such lien signed by said commissioner may be filed for record in the office of the clerk of any town in which such real estate is situated and such lien shall take precedence over any other encumbrance, provided no such lien shall be effective as against any bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer of any interest in any such property. When any tax with respect to which a lien has been recorded under the provisions of this section has been satisfied, said commissioner, upon request of any interested party, shall issue a certificate discharging such lien, which certificate shall be recorded in the same office in which the lien was recorded. Any action for the foreclosure of such lien shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the state in the superior court for the judicial district in which such property subject to such lien is situated, or, if such property is located in two or more judicial districts, in the superior court for any one such judicial district and the court may limit the time for redemption or order the sale of such property or pass such other or further decree as it judges equitable.</p>
