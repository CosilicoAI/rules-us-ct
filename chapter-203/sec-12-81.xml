Such abatement or refund may be granted retroactively to include the assessment day next succeeding the date as of which such individual was entitled to such disability rating as determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, but in no case shall any abatement or refund be made for a period greater than three years.
(iii) The tax collector shall, after examination of such application, refer the same, with the tax collector's recommendations thereon, to the board of selectmen of a town or to the corresponding authority of any other municipality, and shall certify to the amount of abatement or refund to which the applicant is entitled. Upon receipt of such application and certification, the selectmen or other duly constituted authority shall, in case the tax has not been paid, issue a certificate of abatement or, in case the whole tax or part of the tax has been paid, draw an order upon the treasurer in favor of such applicant for such amount, without interest. Any action so taken by such selectmen or other authority shall be a matter of record and the tax collector shall be notified in writing of such action.
