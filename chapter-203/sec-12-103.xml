            <p>Sec. 12-103. Appeals.The owner of such land may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which such property is situated, from the valuation of the assessors, both in respect to such land and the timber thereon, within the time and in the manner provided for appeals from the doings of boards of assessment appeals. If the town within which land classified by the State Forester as forest land is situated claims that such land is not intended by the owner thereof in good faith to be used for forestry purposes, such town may appeal from the decision of the State Forester so classifying such land to said court. The owner of such land may also appeal to said court from the decision of the State Forester refusing such classification. Such appeals shall be taken within thirty days after the filing of the certificate of classification in the office of the assessor of such town or the refusal of such classification, as the case may be, and shall be brought by petition in writing with proper citation, signed by competent authority, to the adverse parties, at least twelve days before the return day. Said court shall have the same powers in respect to such appeals as are provided by section12-117a.
