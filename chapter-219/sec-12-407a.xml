                <p>(A) If a customer believes that an amount of tax or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing. The customer shall include in such written notification the street address for the customer's place of primary use, the account name and number for which the customer requests a correction, a description of the error asserted by the customer and any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request. No later than sixty days after the date of receiving a notice under this subdivision, the home service provider shall review its records. If such review establishes that the amount of tax, or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is erroneous, then the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to two years from the date of the customer's written notification. If such review establishes that the amount of tax, or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, then the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer.
(B) If the customer is not satisfied with the explanation of the home service provider under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the customer may claim a refund from the taxing jurisdiction affected, provided the customer has first exhausted the remedy available to customers under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, and, if the customer has done so and if the taxing jurisdiction affected is this state, the claim is made within the time prescribed in section12-425.</p>

              <p>If nontaxable charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from taxable charges for telecommunications services, then the nontaxable charges may be subject to tax unless the provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to tax under this chapter from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business. A customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for services unless the customer's provider separately states the charges for nontaxable services from taxable charges for telecommunications services or the provider elects, after receiving written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.
