              <p>If the taxpayer is an S corporation or an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the credit may be claimed by the shareholders or partners of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a single member limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, the credit may be claimed by such limited liability company's owner, provided such owner is a person subject to the tax imposed under this chapter or chapter 229.
