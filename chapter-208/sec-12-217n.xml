              <p>of this section, any aerospace company or in the case of a combined return, any combined group including an aerospace company, shall be subject to this subsection for any income year commencing on or after January 1, 1993, and prior to January 1, 1996. For purposes of this subsection, an aerospace company is any taxpayer, whether or not included in a combined return, engaged principally in the aerospace industry whose research and development expenses during each of the income years beginning on or after January 1, 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively, exceeded two hundred million dollars. No aerospace company, or in the case of a combined return, a combined group including an aerospace company, shall be allowed any credit under this section for any income year to which this subsection applies in which the aggregate transfers by an aerospace company, if any, of historical economic base functions outside of this state, other than to a location outside the United States, since January 1, 1993, through the end of such income year, have materially reduced the historical economic base functions in this state. For purposes of this subsection, the historical economic base functions shall be those economic base functions conducted by an aerospace company, which need not be all economic base functions of the aerospace company, in this state on January 1, 1993, whose continuance in this state, as determined by the commissioner in his discretion, will further the policies set forth in section32-221. Such historical economic base functions shall be set forth in a binding memorandum of understanding between the commissioner and an aerospace company that may be entered into at any time prior to the expiration of the first income year to which this subsection applies, with sufficient specificity to allow the commissioner and the aerospace company to determine in all income years subject to this subsection whether there has been such a reduction in said historical economic base functi</p>

The historical Connecticut wage base shall be the Connecticut wage base for the third full income year immediately preceding the current income year; provided the historical Connecticut wage base for the first three income years commencing on or after January 1, 1993, shall be the Connecticut wage base for May 1993, converted to an annual basis. The following shall not constitute a workforce reduction for any income year: (A) A reduction of wages attributable to the transfer of work done by a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, by the combined group, in this state to a party in this state; (B) a reduction of wages attributable to the transfer of work done by a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, by the combined group, outside the United States; or (C) a reduction in wages attributable to reductions in volume, productivity improvements or the discontinuance of operations due to obsolescence or the like.

Not later than sixty days thereafter, the commissioner shall review the certification and, if the commissioner determines that there has been no more than a six per cent workforce reduction, net of any such offsets, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of eligibility stating the amount of net workforce reduction so determined for said income year, if any. The commissioner shall not issue a certificate of eligibility for any income year in which the commissioner determines that there has been more than a six per cent net workforce reduction.
