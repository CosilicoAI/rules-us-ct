              <p>Whenever a cigarette vending machine is not properly identified as required by this section, or whenever any unstamped cigarettes are found in any machine in violation of this chapter, or whenever any cigarette vending machine is placed in a location in violation of section12-289a, the commissioner or an authorized agent of the commissioner shall seal the machine to prevent sale or removal of any cigarettes from the machine until such time as the violation is corrected in the presence of an authorized agent of the commissioner. Any person other than an authorized agent of the Commissioner of Revenue Services who knowingly removes or otherwise tampers with any seal or seals placed on any vending machine by the commissioner or an authorized agent shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year or both. The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of any cigarette vending machine operator for failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or regulations related thereto, following a hearing with respect to which notice in writing, specifying the time and place of such hearing and requiring such operator to show cause why such license should not be revoked, is mailed or delivered to such operator not less than ten days preceding the date of such hearing. Such notice may be served personally or by registered or certified mail. The commissioner shall not issue a new license to a former licensee whose license was revoked unless the commissioner is satisfied that such former licensee will comply with the provisions of this chapter or regulations related thereto.
